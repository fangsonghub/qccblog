**Quantized Complex Crypto** was a blog name that Fang Song came up
  with not long after he started his PhD journey. He scribbled a word
  or two then, but they didn't go anywhere, unfortunately. A few years
  later, he decided to give it a second chance. Don't be disappointed
  should it not go far, *again*!

Fang Song is a theoretical computer scientist, working on exciting
subjects that **some day** people will truly care. Find out what he
does [academically](http://www.fangsong.info).
